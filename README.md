![There are three ways to use this integration. Install package - build and run your own applications. Run the CLI - run on-demand directly from your terminal. Schedule an automation with GitHub - get started in minutes - no coding required](docs/ways-to-use.png)

## First Time Setup

To set up this integration you will need some details from Notion. To get these details please follow the [First Time Setup guide](docs/setup.md).

## Application Credentials

## Package Usage

Install the package with the following command

```
$ gem install notion_orbit
```

Then, run `bundle install` from your terminal.

You can instantiate a client by either passing in the required credentials during instantiation or by providing them in your `.env` file.

### Instantiation with credentials:

```ruby
client = NotionOrbit::Client.new(
    orbit_api_key: YOUR_API_KEY,
    orbit_workspace_id: YOUR_ORBIT_WORKSPACE_ID,
    notion_api_key: YOUR_NOTION_API_KEY,
    notion_database_id: YOUR_NOTION_DATABASE_ID,
    notion_workspace_slug: YOUR_NOTION_WORKSPACE_SLUG
)
```

### Instantiation with credentials in dotenv file:

```ruby
client = NotionOrbit::Client.new
```

### Fetching New Notes 

Once, you have an instantiated client, you can fetch new notes and add them to your Orbit workspace by invoking the `#notes` method on the client:

```ruby
client.notes
```

## CLI Usage

You can also use this package with the included CLI. To use the CLI pass in the required environment variables on the command line before invoking the CLI.

To check for new event RSVPs:

```bash
$ ORBIT_API_KEY=... ORBIT_WORKSPACE_ID=... NOTION_API_KEY=... NOTION_DATABASE_ID=... NOTION_WORKSPACE_SLUG=... bundle exec notion_orbit --check-notes
```

## GitHub Actions Automation Setup

âš¡ You can set up this integration in a matter of minutes using our GitHub Actions template. It will run regularly to add new activities to your Orbit workspace. All you need is a GitHub account.
