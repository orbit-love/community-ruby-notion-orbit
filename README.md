![There are three ways to use this integration. Install package - build and run your own applications. Run the CLI - run on-demand directly from your terminal. Schedule an automation with GitHub - get started in minutes - no coding required](docs/ways-to-use.png)

## First Time Setup

To set up this integration you will need some details from Notion. To get these details please follow the [First Time Setup guide](docs/setup.md).

## Application Credentials

The application requires the following environment variables:

| Variable                | Description                 | More Info                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NOTION_API_KEY`        | The secret Notion API key   | Follow the [First Time Setup Guide](docs/setup.md) for instructions on finding the API key                                                                                            |
| `NOTION_WORKSPACE_SLUG` | Your Notion workspace name           | If your website address is `https://notion.so/my-workspace/` then your slug is `my-workspace`                                                                                            |
| `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`    | The ID of the Notion database this integration is tracking           | Your database ID the part of your Notion database URL that follows after your workspace slug and before the question mark (`?`). The ID is 32 characters long, containing numbers and letters.<br/>![Screenshot of how to identify the database ID](docs/database-id-location.png) |
| `ORBIT_API_KEY`         | API key for Orbit           | Found in `Account Settings` in your Orbit workspace                                                        |
| `ORBIT_WORKSPACE_ID`    | ID for your Orbit workspace | Last part of the Orbit workspace URL, i.e. `https://app.orbit.love/my-workspace`, the ID is `my-workspace` |

## Package Usage

Install the package with the following command

```
$ gem install notion_orbit
```

Then, run `bundle install` from your terminal.

You can instantiate a client by either passing in the required credentials during instantiation or by providing them in your `.env` file.

### Instantiation with credentials:

```ruby
client = NotionOrbit::Client.new(
    orbit_api_key: YOUR_API_KEY,
    orbit_workspace_id: YOUR_ORBIT_WORKSPACE_ID,
    notion_api_key: YOUR_NOTION_API_KEY,
    notion_database_id: YOUR_NOTION_DATABASE_ID,
    notion_workspace_slug: YOUR_NOTION_WORKSPACE_SLUG
)
```

### Instantiation with credentials in dotenv file:

```ruby
client = NotionOrbit::Client.new
```

### Fetching New Notes 

Once you have an instantiated client, you can fetch new notes and add them to your Orbit workspace by invoking the `#notes` method on the client.

New notes will be added to the respective member profiles located by email address. If a member cannot be found by the email address, a new member will be created.

The database entry must have the two following properties in order for the note to be sent to Orbit:

* `Send to Orbit` as a **selected checkbox**
* `Member Email` with the Orbit member's email address

![Database Properties Setup](docs/setup-table-for-orbit.png)

Then, once those fields are set up, the method can be called as follows:

```ruby
client.notes
```

#### Supported Notion Content Blocks and Types

This integration has built-in support to convert the following Notion content block and types into markdown and rendered in Orbit:

* Heading Level 1
* Heading Level 2
* Heading Level 3
* Numbered List
* Bulleted List
* Paragraph Block
* To-Do List
* Bold Font
* Italic Font
* Code Blocks

## CLI Usage

You can also use this package with the included CLI. To use the CLI pass in the required environment variables on the command line before invoking the CLI.

To check for new notes:

```bash
$ ORBIT_API_KEY=... ORBIT_WORKSPACE_ID=... NOTION_API_KEY=... NOTION_DATABASE_ID=... NOTION_WORKSPACE_SLUG=... bundle exec notion_orbit --check-notes
```

## GitHub Actions Automation Setup

âš¡ You can set up this integration in a matter of minutes using our GitHub Actions template. It will run regularly to add new activities to your Orbit workspace. All you need is a GitHub account.
